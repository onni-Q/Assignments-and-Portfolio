# Introduction

## About Me & My Research

### Background

I'm Onni, a third-year media and info student and Blues enthusiast. This portfolio analyzes two AI-generated Blues songs I created for a course assignment.

## Corpus Description

### Data Source

The corpus consists of musical information about the two AI-generated Blues songs.  The data is stored in a CSV file located at `/Users/olenonniboi/Desktop/mysoundtrackanalysis.csv`. This file should contain columns like `song_name`, `tempo`, `key`, `mode`, `instruments`, etc.  *(Make sure this path is correct and accessible from where you're running the R Markdown file.  If you're publishing this, consider a relative path or including the CSV in the same directory.)*
